# FLASK INTRODUCTION
- flask is a light weight framework that supports building of web applications.It uses python.

- - The following are requrements before you start

### Python
 - ensure you have python 
- Enter{python --version} to check if your version is up to date.

### Dependencies
 - this are distributions that get installed immedietly python is installed and they are:
  - Werkzeug implements WSGI, the standard Python interface between applications and servers.

  - Jinja is a template language that renders the pages your application serves.

   - MarkupSafe comes with Jinja. It escapes untrusted input when rendering templates to avoid injection attacks.

   - ItsDangerous securely signs data to ensure its integrity. This is used to protect Flaskâ€™s session cookie.

   - Click is a framework for writing command line applications. It provides the flask command and allows adding custom management commands.

    - Blinker provides support for Signals.

## Virtualenvironment
 - it is used to manage your dependencies and allows foy you to carry out development and deployment in an controlled environment incase your program crushes.

### creating a virtual environment
 - mkdir myproject
  - cd myproject
 - py -3 -m venv venv

###  activating virtual environment
- venv\scripts\activate
 - - if you encounter this error:File <path>\script.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.
  
        - 1.enter powershell terminall as an administrator{Get-ExecutionPolicy}
        _  if your policy is Restricted, Enter
        {Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned} to change policy to RemoteSIgned.
        then procced to activate.

### install flask
- After activating virtualenvironment {pip install flask}

- to collect and display all dipendencies Enter{pip freeza > requrements,txt}

* * WHEN SENDING PROJECTS ON GIT THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT IS NOT REQUIRED.THE SOLUTION IS TO EXCLUDE IT IN A FILE NAMED GITIGNORE.create file (.gitignore) then enter the file and add the virtual environment(venv\)

# HOW TO RUN A FLASK APP
 - 1.import flask
 - - {from flak import FLASK}


 - 2.PUT Flask in the app and create an instance of an object
 - - {app = Flask(__name__)}
 - 3.route a function
 - - {@app.route('/')
    -  def index():
        - return "hello world"
 }

 - Run the app
  - - {if __name__ =='__main__':
         - app.run(debug=True, host="0.0.0.0", port=7000)}
        -DEBUG ENSURES THE SERVER REFRESHES ANY TIME A CHANGE IS MADE IN THE APP WHILE HOST ='0.0.0.0" CARRIES THE IP ADRESS OF YOUR COMPUTER.
